# lyric_generator

The aims of this project are to:
* Scrape all song lyrics for a given band from the internet
* Store these in the most appropriate format (perhaps a postgresql database)
* Train a Markov chain lyric generator (or something similar) on these to generate new songs based on these lyrics

I'll test my code with the songs from My Chemical Romance and Muse.
